  "":"",
  "Azalea":
    "Azaleas are flowering shrubs in the genus Rhododendron, particularly the former sections Tsutsuji (evergreen) and Pentanthera (deciduous). Azaleas bloom in the spring (April and May in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, and October and November in the Southern Hemisphere), their flowers often lasting several weeks. Shade tolerant, they prefer living near or under trees. They are part of the family Ericaceae.\n\n"
    "Plant enthusiasts have selectively bred azaleas for hundreds of years. This human selection has produced over 10,000 different cultivars which are propagated by cuttings. Azalea seeds can also be collected and germinated.\n\n"
    "In addition to being renowned for its beauty, the azalea is also highly toxic—it contains andromedotoxins in both its leaves and nectar, including honey from the nectar. Bees are deliberately fed on Azalea/Rhododendron nectar in some parts of Turkey, producing a mind-altering, potentially medicinal, and occasionally lethal honey known as \"mad honey\".",
  "Dahlia":
    "Dahlia is a genus of bushy, tuberous, herbaceous perennial plants native to Mexico and Central America. A member of the Compositae (also called Asteraceae) family of dicotyledonous plants, its garden relatives thus include the sunflower, daisy, chrysanthemum, and zinnia. There are 42 species of dahlia, with hybrids commonly grown as garden plants. Flower forms are variable, with one head per stem; these can be as small as 5 cm (2 in) diameter or up to 30 cm (1 ft) (\"dinner plate\"). This great variety results from dahlias being octoploids—that is, they have eight sets of homologous chromosomes, whereas most plants have only two. In addition, dahlias also contain many transposons—genetic pieces that move from place to place upon an allele—which contributes to their manifesting such great diversity.\n\n"
    "The stems are leafy, ranging in height from as low as 30 cm (12 in) to more than 1.8—2.4 m (6—8 ft). The majority of species do not produce scented flowers. Like most plants that do not attract pollinating insects through scent, they are brightly colored, displaying most hues, with the exception of blue.\n\n"
    "The dahlia was declared the national flower of Mexico in 1963. The tubers were grown as a food crop by the Aztecs, but this use largely died out after the Spanish Conquest. Attempts to introduce the tubers as a food crop in Europe were unsuccessful.",
  "Hawaiian hibiscus":
    "While hibiscus shrubs are not rare, but you have to travel to the Hawaiian Islands of Oahu and Moloka'i to find these hibiscus flowers. Even then, you only see these flowering shrubs in the wet mountain forest areas.\n\n"
    "There are several species of Hawaiian hibiscus, also called koki'o. These plants produce large beautiful flowers, some of which give off a pleasant fragrance. The large tropical flowers can be pink, yellow, orange, or purple.\n\n"
    "From all the species, it's the Hawaiian hibiscus immaculatus species that is the rarest flowering shrub. These native plants are only found in a few places on Moloka'i Island. The rare flowers are so tricky to find that the subspecies is on the endangered list of rare plants.",
  "Lupine":
    "The species are mostly herbaceous perennial plants 0.3-1.5 metres (1-5 feet) tall, but some are annual plants and a few are shrubs up to 3 m (10 ft) tall. An exception is the chamis de monte (Lupinus jaimehintoniana) of Oaxaca in Mexico, which is a tree up to 8 m (26 ft) tall. Lupins have soft green to grey-green leaves which may be coated in silvery hairs, often densely so. The leaf blades are usually palmately divided into five to 28 leaflets, or reduced to a single leaflet in a few species of the southeastern United States and eastern South America. The flowers are produced in dense or open whorls on an erect spike, each flower 1-2 cm long. The pea-like flowers have an upper standard, or banner, two lateral wings, and two lower petals fused into a keel. The flower shape has inspired common names such as bluebonnets and quaker bonnets. The fruit is a pod containing several seeds.\n\n"
    "Many annual species of lupins are used in agriculture and most of them have Mediterranean origin. While originally cultivated as a green manure or forage, lupins are increasingly grown for their seeds, which can be used as an alternative to soybeans. Sweet (low alkaloid) lupins are highly regarded as a stock feed, particularly for ruminants, but also for pigs and poultry and more recently as an ingredient in aqua-feeds. The market for lupin seeds for human food is currently small, but researchers believe it has great potential. Lupin seeds are considered \"superior\" to soybeans in certain applications and evidence is increasing for their potential health benefits. They contain similar protein to soybean, but less fat. As a food source, they are gluten-free and high in dietary fiber, amino acids, and antioxidants, and they are considered to be prebiotic. About 85% of the world's lupin seeds are grown in Western Australia.",
  "Olearia":
    "Olearia, most commonly known as daisy-bush, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae, the largest of the flowering plant families in the world. Olearia are found in Australia, New Guinea and New Zealand. The genus includes herbaceous plants, shrubs and small trees. The latter are unusual among the Asteraceae and are called tree daisies in New Zealand. All bear the familiar daisy-like composite flowerheads in white, pink, mauve or purple.\n\n"
    "Plants in the genus Olearia are shrubs of varying sizes, characterised by a composite flower head arrangement with single-row ray florets enclosed by small overlapping bracts arranged in rows. The flower petals are more or less equal in length. The centre of the bi-sexual floret is disc shaped and may be white, yellowish or purplish, generally with 5 lobes. Flower heads may be single or clusters in leaf axils or at the apex of branchlets. Leaves may be smooth, glandular or with a sticky secretion. The leaves may grow opposite, alternate, arranged sparsely or clustered. Leaf margins either entire or lobed, with or without a stalk. The fruit are dry slightly compressed, one-seeded, narrow-elliptic or egg-shaped with longitudinal ridges and smooth or with sparse hairs.",
  "Plumeria alba":
    "Plumeria alba, commonly called white frangipani or nosegay, is a small rounded deciduous tree of the dogbane family that grows in a vase-shape to 15-25' tall. It features fragrant white flowers with yellow centers. Upright branches are thick but weak, and have a milky sap. This species is native to Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, but has been introduced into a number of tropical areas around the world. Very fragrant 5-petaled flowers (to 3\" wide) bloom in terminal clusters at the branch tips from spring to fall. Flowers are white with yellow centers. Oblong-lanceolate green leaves (to 12\" long) are spirally clustered at the stem ends. Fruits are cylindrical pods (to 8\") that are rarely formed in cultivation.\n\n"
    "Plumeria flowers (particularly those of Plumeria rubra) are used to make leis and a scented oil in a number of Pacific islands including Hawaii.",
  "Windflower":
    "Windflowers grow underground from tubers or rhizomes to form small colonies. Depending on the variety, the flower stalks grow from six inches tall to nearly six feet. Flower color varies widely, but the blossoms are generally two to three inches in diameter with thin, delicate petals. The deeply divided foliage is dark green and clustered near the base of the plants.\n\n"
    "All parts of windflower are toxic. One would have to eat a large quantity to be in real danger, but even a small quantity will cause severe, but temporary, pain in the mouth. Significant exposure to the sap of the plants can cause dermatitis, so it's best to wear gloves and protective clothing when working with windflower.\n\n"
    "Windflowers grow best in partial shade. In cooler climates they can tolerate full sun, but in hot climates, it's best if they are sheltered from the late afternoon sun. These are largely woodland plants, meaning they appreciate rich soil that is high in organic matter. Plant on a mound if drainage is poor and amend the planting area with compost before putting windflowers in the ground.",
  "Wisteria":
    "Wisteria is a long-lived vining plant with cascades of blue to purple flowers that look spectacular hanging from a pergola or archway in spring and early summer. However, this vine is a fast and aggressive grower—often reaching 30+ feet long—and is known to grow quite heavy. Wisteria vines will work their way into any crook or cranny they can reach, so it's advised to not plant them too near to your home.\n\n"
    "Wisteria flowers are beautifully fragrant, providing a feast for the senses. After flowering, a brown, bean-like pod stays on the plant until winter. Blooms only appear on new growth.\n\n"
    "Note: Plant wisteria with caution! All parts of the wisteria plant contain substances called lectin and wisterin, which are toxic to pets, livestock, and humans. These toxins can cause anything from nausea and diarrhea to death if consumed in large amounts.",

"n a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.",
"It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats—the hobbit was fond of visitors. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill—The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it—and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage. The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden, and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.",
"This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected: you could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him. This is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure, and found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but he gained—well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.",
